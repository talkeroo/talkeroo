# talkeroo

This is an experiment where random groups of 3-4 people talk about climate change in a video call for 1h per week. The purpose is to break out of your bubble a bit and talk to unknown but interested people. If this happens regularly, good ideas, knowledge and insights should be spread among all participants.

If you want to participate, check out the calender for the next date. Then add your name into the organization spreadsheet.
